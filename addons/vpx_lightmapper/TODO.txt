TODO
- Implement surface positionning relative to a ramp
- Add support for loading embedded LZW encoded bmp files (very seldom, just one identified in the full example table)
- JP's Star Trek has a wrong texture positionning (panel above ramp)
- When importing plastics wall, create 2 meshes: one for the plastic with a plastic shader (enlarged for the bevelling to be visible), one for the image (bpy.ops.mesh.solidify(thickness=-0.01), invert selection and delete, then scale on z axis)
- Support 'active' (i.e. non opaque bake) objects for the occluder selection
- Layback lattice breaks the split normals: we should rotate them accordingly when this is toggled
- When loading library, update existing node groups instead of skipping them
- Include an asset folder, register it as an asset library when the plugin is activated, move the core assets to this asset library instead of loading them directly, populate with additional assets (screws, bulbs, posts, inserts, materials,...)
- Add glow map baking (camera space post process bake) => now that light HDR is clean, can't we just live with VPX bloom ?
- Add a user configurable way of stopping modifier application when baking (for the moment hardcoded to stop on fine bevelling)
- Hide lights (make them not visible, needs VPX update since fading is only performed on visible light at the moment)

Layers
- Playfield with inserts cups => static (splitted from the rest in order to be rendered with reflections in VPX)
- Solid parts => static
- Movable parts => opaque but not static
- Translucent parts (Insert overlays and borders, Plastic ramps, decals, under playfield glass): blended due to transparency, sorted back to front

Optimizations 
- Lights are always rendered (eventually bulb, then additive bulb). Discards: not visible, intensity = 0, color & color2 = Black
- Unshaded path can be more efficient (single tex fetch)
- HDR texture should be half float (48b instead of 96b) to improve cache hit and limit memory bandwidth consumption

VPX render path
0. Render (apart) mirror from static prerendered and dynamic parts
0. Render (apart) light buffer from lights flagged as transmitting (bulb checked with transmit > 0)
1. Copy static playfield without depth, and static parts with depth
2. Copy mirror without depth (depth tested to static parts, since they are the only one in the depth buffer)
3. Render playfield depth
4. Render dynamic opaque parts (objects, balls, DMDs)
5. Render dynamic translucent parts (objects and DMDs)




Closed items:
- Add clean nestmap padding for opaque objects using the nearest opaque color
- Compute and use the HDR range of the used part of the render, not the one of the full render
- Lights are rendered to the light buffer if they have transmission scale => turn it to 0 on export
- Generate an helper vbs file (instead of putting it inside the script
- Add support for UV projected movables that follow the same path but generate their own mesh even for lightmaps
- Rewrite Packmap generation for higher quality (renders should stay untouched, since they guarantee the higher possible quality) => only possible with custom nesting algorithm
  . Constrain rotation to 0/90/180/270
  . Guarantee a scale of 1 (by iterative packing, disabling all scaling)
  . Build packmap by data transfer (RGBA pixel data copy using a padded mask), not rendering which may cause bluriness (unaligned pixels and loose precision on borders)
- When baking, perform sanity checks: Check for collection off => not needed anymore after rewrite
- Simplify the core materials, they can be done with simple Principled BSDF => not that important (they are not supposed ot be really used, and they work)
- Evaluate performing HDR with multiple lightmap (1 for 0-1, then 1 for 1-256) => moved lightmap to EXR
- Implement 'Movable' bake mode (each object is baked to a separate mesh, keeping its origin) => not kept. For complex movables, manual adjusted baking will be required anyway. So don't go down a too complex path
  . Object must be UV unwrapped, and must have either a VLM.BakeTex node in its material (first slot) or has an imported VPX image (bake will be the same size as the image)
  . Light map are computed on the UV unwrapped model, filtered based on a custom threshold
  . Implementation progress:
    x At group step, just hide them
    . At render step, set them to hide/indirect for others, then adapt material (create VLM.BakeTex if missing, same size as VPX Texture) perform a bake for each movable/light scenarios, also compute light threshold of the bake and allow to access it from the UI (for easy adjustment of the lighmap bake threshold)
    . At mesh step, copy the movables to bake result and generate a light mesh for each on the lightmap above threshold
    . At packmap step, copy bakes to export (with exr to png/webp conversion)
    . At export step, include them in the VPX and produce sync code
- Rewrite VBS fader to apply a fading curve based on filament temperature, adapting color (K to RGB) and intensity (using the HDR part, to view filament cooling down in flashers :)) => just plug in Lampz or the table fading system
- Unhide objects when creating packmaps to avoid error => won't be needed with pack nest
- Allow the user to select the final tonemapping => not needed anymore, tonemapping removed (done by VPX)
- Identify static/active bake and export accordingly (done for opacity, missing for under playfield which, I think, need to be marked as active)
- VPX: implement HDR for primitive (very simple, same as flasher)
- In a split light group, bake same VPX lights together
- Occluder selection tools delete compositor nodes... Save them and restore them afterward
- Add the ability to bake additional environment lighting as additive lighting (base bake = dark pub or even no IBL, then additional for lit up room)
- Add support for multiple object to be baked to the same target (for example a simple playfield mesh which holds the bake of the playfield, cut outs, and inserts)
- Add support for using different scales: vpx/inches/cm
- When loading library, update existing node groups instead of reimporting them => now they are skipped (updating would be better)
- When baking packmap, apply adjusted tonemapping to get correct color after tonemapping in VPX
- Check that tonemapping is applied to playfield bake (I don't think it is) => ok for bake mode (anyway, this is supposed to be replaced by NestPacker)
- Split reflection flag between mesh baking (for keeping playfield oriented faces) and exporting (for activating reflection of lightmaps)
- Add an option to disable AOI for selected lights
- don't hide trigger wire
- Don't save depth of renders
- Allow to mark VPX objects as baked without having them in a bake group (when objects are merged for example)
- Apply layback lattice transform when performing UV projection (or clearly state that lattice is not supported by the process)
- Fix pruned faces for sub pixel faces of lightmaps
- Find a way to take in account text overlay with clean alpha borders
- Link multiple object to one bake (for clean export)
- Import fixed view node groups, rename all core node groups as VLM. / VPX.
- Set bake camera pos to Fixed view node groups
- Add black wood bump to JP 13
- Add some scracthes to JP 13
- When baking, check for compositor node setup
- Make 'Bake Target' Collection not renderable
- Improve lighting of JP 13 (all to black, then adjust all insert spots)
- Toggle indirect only for indirect call when baking
- Check why JP 13 stops on bake mesh generation
- Add support for traditional baking the playfield (using view dependent shading) instead of render baking
- Add support for AOI on emissive mesh (sphere bounds of box bounds, then emission power to radiu heuristic)
- Remove overlay as a preprocess/postprocess and integrate it directly in the render
- Recreate the base VPX Material, using only Principled BSDF, with gamma corrected plastic translucency
- Move away from the 'overlay' approach, using a traditional 'bake to' system
  . Overlay should be regular bake objects (rendered), with a bake target (used as mesh targets)
  . At Render stage, render the bake object (eventually mask him with the alpha of the bake target for better borders)
  . At Mesh stage, use the bake target mesh instead of the bake object
  . UI integration: add a 'bake to' field for bake objects PointerProperty(name="Bake To", type=bpy.types.Object), don't render bake to targets
- Add an option to take in account VPX playfield reflection (export with reflection flag, adapt backface culling for the reflected ray)
